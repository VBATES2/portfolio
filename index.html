						<p class="bio">
							Victor graduated from DeVry University in 2009. He was not been able to procure a job in Engineering due to unforseen circumstances, and like most college students just took whatever jobs he could to survive. However, now he is now learning new skills in order to restart and try to make his life better. Victor's plans are to dedicate his extra time to culminate past job experiences and skills and upgrade them through self learning and self improvement.
